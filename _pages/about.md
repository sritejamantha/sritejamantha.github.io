I am currently a postdoctoral research associate in Prof. Zhen-Gang Wangâ€™s research group at Caltech. I specialize in the chemical physics of surfactants and their interfacial phenomena, the physics of polymer self-assembly and dynamics, and computational modeling of rare events in chemical systems.

My research investigations at Caltech focus on understanding a) the ability of polyelectrolytes to prevent CaCO<sub>3</sub> mineralization, and b) the ability of surfactants to improve CO<sub>2</sub> bubble nucleation in polymer foams. These studies are conducted in collaboration with scientists at Dow Chemical Company.

Prior to Caltech, my research activities involved c) modeling and designing gemini surfactant molecules to direct their self-assembly in water into bi-continuous cubic morphologies (such as the gyroid phase), d) studying the structure and dynamic properties of water confined in different self-assembled morphologies of gemini surfactants, e) examining the effect of polymer chain dispersity on the micellization of diblock copolymers in a selective solvent, and f) investigating the dynamics of diblock copolymer self-assembly.

I employed a variety of computational tools and theoretical models to investigate the physical principles underlying each of the research objectives mentioned above. These tools ranged from all-atom and coarse-grained particle-based simulations to study molecular properties of the system, to enhanced sampling approaches such as umbrella sampling, metadynamics, replica exchange molecular simulations, and the transition-state path-finding approach called the string method for modeling rare events in chemistry. Additionally, I utilized equation of state (EoS) approaches like perturbed chain statistical associating fluid theory (PC-SAFT), as well as field-theory-based approaches such as self-consistent field theory (SCFT), classical density functional theory (cDFT), and dynamic density functional theory (DDFT) for the mesoscopic characterization of system properties.
